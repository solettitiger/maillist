# maillist

Need to send a newsletter to a lot of people with Outlook. A list of email addresses separated by a semicolon can be used in BCC as receipients.
To manage the email addresses I use maillist. It can print the whole list or only part of it. You can search, and filter the lists, can verify the email addresses, search for double entries, add or delete items and move an email from one file to another. 


## Usage
```
 -s 		Search for an email address
 -f       	use only one file or use all files (the filter is the filename without the extension)
 -a 		add an email address
 -d 		delete an email address
 -t double	searches for double entries, which you can remove
 -t verify	easy check if email address could be valid
 -m          	move an email address from one file to another
  		just show all email addresses
 -h		prints out short information how to use            
```

## Requirements
- Python 3 installed on your PC


## Installation
Copy all files into a folder on your computer. Edit config.ini to define your files with the email addresses. Make the file `maillist` executable.
